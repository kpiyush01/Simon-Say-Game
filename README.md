Simon Say – Animal Memory Game is an interactive memory-based game inspired by the classic "Simon Says." The game challenges players to focus and recall sequences of blinking animal images. It is designed to enhance short-term memory and attention in a fun and engaging way, suitable for all ages.

Gameplay Mechanics :-
The game screen displays four animal images.

In each level, a sequence of these animals will blink (highlight) one by one.

The player must memorize the order in which the animals blinked.

After the sequence ends, the player repeats the pattern by clicking or tapping the animals in the same order.

Each new level adds one more blink to the sequence, increasing difficulty.

The game continues indefinitely, allowing players to progress as far as their memory can take them.

If the player inputs the wrong sequence, the game restarts from level 1.

Features :-
 Simple and colorful UI featuring animal images.

2-second blink duration for clear visibility and better memorization.

No level limit – endless progression based on memory skills.

Interactive feedback for correct and incorrect responses.

Can be implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for web-based platforms.

Objectives :-
Train and improve memory retention.

Encourage focus and pattern recognition.

Provide a fun and educational tool for children and adults.
